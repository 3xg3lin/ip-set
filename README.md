# ip-set
This is automation tool for take automatically ip address.

```
cd ip-set/
sudo make install
cd src/
sudo ./ip-set.sh -s
```  

### Usage  
I suggest you the `-s,--select` parameter. Because by default the interface is set to **-eth0**.  
If you want to list the interface just to see them, you can use the `-l,--list` parameter.
